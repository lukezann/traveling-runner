# traveling-runner

In 2023, I ran 3,068.9 mi.
This is more than the distance between my hometown, Los Angeles, and my school, Williams College (2,888.2 mi, according to Google).
To challenge myself both programming-wise (expand into frontend development) and athletically (run more miles),
I am developing a web app that will track my running progress as I accumulate miles over the year.
I will attempt to visit every one of my teammates before finishing at Williams before the end of 2024.
